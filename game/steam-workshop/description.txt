[h1]üõ†New Construction Optionsüõ†[/h1]

This mod provides an new gameplay features, a üìÉ RULES.INI file üìÉ for Tiberian Dawn & ‚öô Lua event scripting ‚öô.

Currently only one C&C code mod can run at once, this mod aims to fix that problem by providing a rules file and a scripting API. 

Simply write your mod using this interface instead of editing the source code directly.
