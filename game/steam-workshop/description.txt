This mod provides an extensive üìÉ RULES.INI file üìÉ for Tiberian Dawn & ‚öô Lua event scripting ‚öô.

Currently only one C&C dll mod can run at a time, this mod aims to fix that problem by providing a rules file and a scripting API. Simply write your mod using this interface instead of editing the source code directly.
