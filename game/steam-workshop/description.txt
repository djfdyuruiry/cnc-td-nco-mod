This mod provides an extensive 📃 RULES.INI file 📃 for Tiberian Dawn & ⚙ Lua event scripting ⚙.

Unfortunately only one C&C dll mod can run at a time, this mod aims to fix that problem by providing a rules file and a scripting API. Simply write your mod using this interface instead of editing the source code directly.
